# arceus-shirts-art
Made some shirts for my brother. He wanted arceus on a shirt but we couldn’t find any, so I made two for him. He helped in making the backgrounds :)
I used oil paint on two white tshirts which was pretty difficult, both because I wasn’t using the correct medium and because cloth absorbs paint quickly and is hard to work with.
